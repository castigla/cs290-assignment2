		To enrich the characters at its core, New Girl’s fourth season looks to external sources. The show has had a lot of fun, and continues to have fun, with its characters’ tight-knit bonds—but that sort of thing can get claustrophobic. To give itself new storytelling real estate, the fourth-season comeback looks beyond the loft: Jess takes on new responsibilities at school, which are complicated by a workplace romance. Winston turns out to be a great cop, and the job feeds his eccentricities in unpredictable ways. Nick finds a sugar mama, so Cece’s tending bar more often, which gives the writers a more organic way of incorporating Hannah Simone into every episode. These are all positive moves, and they keep the show fresh at a time when other series might settle into routine.

		Unfortunately, the instincts that opened all of those storytelling doors are kicked into overdrive in “Coming Out,” leading to a pileup of plot with wonky priorities. It’s a busy episode (a quality season four has mostly downplayed), and while there’s a lot of funny material for the guys, the big emotional beats for Jess don’t hit as hard as they should.
